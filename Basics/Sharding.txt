Sharding

Horizontal partitioning
	Put diff rows into diff tables.
	Con(缺点): if the value whose range is used for sharding is not chosen carefully, the partitioning scheme will lead to unbalanced servers.

Vertival partitioning
	Divide data for a specific feature to their own server.
	Pro（优点）: Straightforward to implement; Low impact on the application.
	Con: To support growth of the application, a database may need further partitioning.

Directory-based partitioning
	A lookup service knows the partitioning scheme and abstracts it away from the database.
	Allow addition of db servers or change of partitioning schema without impacting application.
	Con（缺点）： Can be single point faliure.
