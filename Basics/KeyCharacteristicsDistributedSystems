Key Characteristics of Distributed Systems

Scalability: 
	The capability of a system to grow and manage increased demand.
	A system that can contibuously evolve to support growing amount of work.
	Horizontal scaling: Adding more server.
	Vertical scaling: Add more resource(CPU, RAM, storage, etc) to an existing server.

Reliability:
	Reliability is the probability that a system will fail in a given period. 在某段时间fail的可能性。
	A distributed system is reliable if it keeps delivering its service even when one or multiple components fail. 如果一个分布式系统，在某些部分fail的情况下还能delivering service，那么这个系统就是reliable的。
Availability:  
	the time a system remains operational to perform its required function in a specific period
Efficiency:
	Latency: response time
	Bandwith: amount of data delivered in a given time.
